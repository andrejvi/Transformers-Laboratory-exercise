# Transformers-Laboratory-exercise
This report covers single-phase and three-phase transformer tasks. The single-phase section includes open-circuit and short-circuit tests to calculate parameters and efficiency under different loads. The three-phase section explores various transformer connections to analyze their effect on phase angle between primary and secondary voltages.
